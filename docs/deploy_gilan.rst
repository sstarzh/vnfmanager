.. _gilan:

Step 1. Deploy Gilan blueprint
------------------------------

Once you change all the values in the Gi LAN inputs file and save it locally, upload the file in F5 VNF Manager. It will
define all required parameters for the F5 Gilan yaml blueprint.

1.	Open F5 VNFM, click :guilabel:`Local Blueprints`. The :guilabel:`F5-VNF-Service-Layer-GiLAN_1.0.0.1` main blueprint file appears.

2.  Click :guilabel:`Deploy`.

3.	Enter a name, under :guilabel:`Deployment Inputs`, click |clip_deploy| browse for the :guilabel:`inputs_gilan_udf-v3.yaml` file you edited, and then click :guilabel:`Open`. The Deploy blueprint form is completed automatically with the values you entered in the gilan_inputs.yaml file. Click :guilabel:`Deploy`

.. warning:: Deployment name should be a single word with no spaces, dashes or special characters

4.  On the left-side menu click the :guilabel:`Deployments` blade, in the list next to blueprint you created in the preivous step, expand |menuIcon_deploy|, click :guilabel:`Gilan install`, and then click :guilabel:`Execute`. VNFM starts creating BIG-IP VEs according to the parameters you defined for your network. Also installed includes additional, sub-blueprints packaged with the F5 gilan blueprint.

.. note:: You may see the following error appearing intermittently during the first few minutes of deployment. It doesn't affect the deployment process
    
    .. image:: images/error.png

5.	To view the list of Gilan workflows (for example, scale out group, deregister VE, etc.) that you can run, on the :guilabel:`Deployments` blade, click |menuIcon_deploy| next to your Gilan deployment in the list. A list of applicable workflows for your solution appears. Learn more about |workflows|

.. image:: images/run_wf3.png

6.	To view the multiple BIP-IP VEs created by installing your F5 Gilan blueprint, open your OpenStack project and navigate to :menuselection:`Compute -> Instances`.

.. |menuIcon_deploy| image:: images/menuIcon.png

.. note:: Deployment will take 40-45 minutes to complete. Monitor the process by viewing :guilabel:`Deployments` screen until all nodes are **green**

Resulting Gilan deployment architecture includes 2 DAG and 2 ( master + 1 slave) VNF instances:

For more information about Install Workflow see:
:doc:`Install Workflow <CM-install-wf>`


.. _servervm:

Step 2. Stand up traffic server VM
----------------------------------

Server VM can be launched from CLI or using Horizon UI.

1. To launch traffic server VM from CLI SSH to `controller_neutron VM`

.. image:: images/controller_shortcut.png

Run the following script:

.. code-block:: console

    #./create_trafficserver.sh

.. note:: Script will perform the following actions automatically to simplify lab process:
    1. Add route to traffic_server via DAG1 on router1
    2. Add route to client via DAG2 in userdata.sh for traffic_server
    3. Stand up traffic server with corresponding neutron port/ip and userdata.sh as user data

2. Verify traffic_server VM is in Running state and has correct IP assigned

:menuselection:`Project -> Compute -> Instances`

3. Review target traffic flows

    .. note:: This lab uses pdn_dag_net to return traffic from server to DAG2 instance. This is due to various environment limitations
    
    .. image:: images/networking2.png

    Three-way TCP handshake flow:

    .. image:: images/tcp_3_way2.png

    Apache Bench HTTP request flow:

    .. image:: images/ab_flow2.png
    
    .. note:: For load testing VNF BIG-IP uses a special "CPU killer" iRule which generates a 200 OK answer locally without forwarding traffic to the server for client IP ending with .21 - .24 (.20 IP is passed to traffic server)
    
    Apache Bench Load test flow:

    .. image:: images/ab_load.png

.. _test:

Step 3. Run test traffic to validate connectivity
-------------------------------------------------

1. SSH to UDF `traffic_gen` VM and run Apache Bench and curl commands

    .. code-block:: console

        sudo ab -n 10 -c 1 -b 1400 -B 10.1.20.20 http://10.1.52.101/
        sudo ab -n 10 -c 1 -b 1400 -B 10.1.20.21 http://10.1.52.101/
        sudo ab -n 10 -c 1 -b 1400 -B 10.1.20.22 http://10.1.52.101/
        curl --interface eth1 http://10.1.52.101/
        curl --interface eth1:0 http://10.1.52.101/
        curl --interface eth1:1 http://10.1.52.101/

2. AB Output should contain statisticcal information on average RTT and # of bytes sent/received, among other data. Ensure Apache Bench received data back from the server.

    .. code-block:: console

        100%     10 (longest request)

3. Curl output should depend on the source IP used - for a default client IP (eth1 - 10.1.20.20) curl will return a XML payload in HTTP answer. For other client IPs ( eth1:0-eth1:3 10.1.20.21 - .24) curl will return "Hello!" generated by VNF BIG-IP

.. code-block:: console

    curl --interface eth1:0 http://10.1.52.101/
