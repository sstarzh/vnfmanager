Part VII. (Optional) Uninstall workflow
=======================================

This step will force VNF Manager to remove all BIG-IP and Nagios VMs and corresponding configuration. 

.. note:: It is recommended to skip this step if current UDF deployment will be used later for customer PoCs and/or demos


To uninstall the entire deployment, select :guilabel:`Deployments` --> :guilabel:`F5-VNF-Service-Layer-GiLAN_1.0.0.1` Blueprint 
Expand |menuIcon_deploy|, click :guilabel:`Gilan uninstall` and then click :guilabel:`Execute`.
